            HTML, short for HyperTedt Markup Language, is the coding language used to create a webpage.  The wireframe is the visual aid created to build a site and the html markup is the code needed to create the content that will go into the site.

            Structure of HTML
    </h1>
        <p>
            Similar to an essay, HTML needs to start with a header. It needs to include a body. Paragraphs within that body. as well as a footer.  In the cases of needing specific sections, buttons, links or images to appear, HTML is what creates those spaces for that content to reside.  Ultimately without HTML, all the bells and whistles of color and spacing mean nothing until you know what font to use and what text to include.
