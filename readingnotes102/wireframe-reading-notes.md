    Wireframing is a visual aide for a designer or coder that puts an idea of the function of a website on a page for a reader to understand.  Wireframes can be hand drawn or drawn using software programs or sites. Common sites used are Invision and Balsamiq.

      Three key principles are needed for wireframing to work.
    </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
            Clarity: The clarity of a website should be discernable before any changes to the content, graphics and before intractability has been added. A clear wireframe answers these questions:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    What is the page about?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What can the user do?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Does it satisfy their need?
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
     </ul>
     <ul>
        <li>
            Confidence: The confidence a user gains through navigating your wireframes should be front of mind when creating a proper wireframe.  You will want to consider these questions during the build:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Are buttons, locations, and resources intuitive?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Is navigating user friendly?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Is redundancy required?
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
     </ul>
     <ul>
        <li>
            Simplicity is Key: Fluff is nice, but too much can detract from the site and cause annoyance to the user which can lead to lack of use or sale of products.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Wireframe should be visual guide for what to expect of the site.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Layout should be intuitive for expected audience. Always know your audience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For functionality, is everything required in place before the need for being aesthetically pleasing to your user.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
     </ul>

     Beginners making wireframes may find it easier to start on paper when building.  Paper drafts allow changes easier especially as more detail is introduced. After the initial draft is made, paper prototypes are one of the more reasonable ways to start as they are cheaper to create, recreate, adjust and scrap if needed. By the time code is introduced into the prototype, detailed decisions are planned out and errors are less likely to be present.
