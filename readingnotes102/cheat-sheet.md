# **Why are Text Editors a coders best friend?** 
Text Editors are software programs you download and install on your computer to help you code. Primarily used to help build code for websites using expansions and other features.  These features are meant to make coding easier by utilizing:

  
  1. Code completion: system used to identify that what the code end should be through predictive text
  2. Syntax highlighting: grouping of tasks and processes through color coding
  3. Themes: background and text colors to enhance physical and emotional wellness by reducing eye strain and fatigue
  4. Extensions: additions in text editing software to make the coding language being utilized easier to manuever, manipulate and utilize
  

  
### Considerations for Chosing the Right Text Editor

   Though functionality is hugely necessary with text editors, personal preference and language needs are the primary reason to be specific about your text editor. The right editor is decided by knowing your computer specifications and capabilities from hardware to software.  In utilizing objects called Tags, specific variables are able to be cataloged with the intent of creating ease of access to a specific link or idea. A few more things should be considered when researching the right Text Editor for yourself.  Those include:
    
  
  1. Price: Is the text editor Free or is there a cost assigned?
  2. Inclusion: Are the needed Expansions or tasks included in the built in software?
  3. Relevance: Is the editor still utilized by many and will the updates to it maintain relevance in the changes of the world?
  
 
     Once those questions are answered the next step is navigation.  What are the navigating codes used for that specific editor?
      *examples include:* 

     **=Bold
      
      which renders as **Bold**

      *=Itallics

      which render as *Itallic*
