# Text

Since HTML defines the structure of a webpage, the text within it is very important. The process of detemining what pieces go where so the user or visitor of the page can understand it is due to the semntic matkup of the HTML.

Here are some examples of tag elements that are used to structure the text.

>`<p> is for pharagraph,`

>`<h1> is for headings and the number after the "h" determines what level of heading it is.`

Now lets cover some emphasis eamples:

>`<b> gives you the ` **bold** `emphasis.`

>`<i> is for `*itallic* `emphasis.`

>`<sup> is for superscript.` `<sub> is for subscript.`

`<strong> has a default emphasis of bold.`
`<em> emphasis defaults to itallic.`

Empty elements are used when ther is no need for a closing tag as all the needed content is usually rendered on a page. Here are some empty elements.

`<br /> is for line breaks.`

`<hr /> gives the horizontal rule for a horizontal line.`

> `<blockquote> for longer quotes into a pharagraph.`
`<q> is for shorter quotes.`
