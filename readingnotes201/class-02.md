# Text and Visual Changes

## Text

Since HTML defines the structure of a webpage, the text within it is very important. The process of detemining what pieces go where so the user or visitor of the page can understand it is due to the semntic matkup of the HTML.

Here are some examples of tag elements that are used to structure the text.

>`<p> is for pharagraph,`

>`<h1> is for headings and the number after the "h" determines what level of heading it is.`

Now lets cover some emphasis eamples:

>`<b> gives you the ` **bold** `emphasis.`

>`<i> is for `*itallic* `emphasis.`

>`<sup> is for superscript.` `<sub> is for subscript.`

`<strong> has a default emphasis of bold.`
`<em> emphasis defaults to itallic.`

Empty elements are used when ther is no need for a closing tag as all the needed content is usually rendered on a page. Here are some empty elements.

`<br /> is for line breaks.`

`<hr /> gives the horizontal rule for a horizontal line.`

> `<blockquote> for longer quotes into a pharagraph.`
`<q> is for shorter quotes.`

`<abbr> for abbreviations.`

`<cite> to cite references.`

`<dfn> for a defining instance of new term and is sometimes displayed as itallic.`

`<address> contains the information about the site creator.`

`<ins>, <del> and <s> tags are for changing the content in the paragraph.`

# Visual Appeal

Visual appeal is achieved through CSS. CSS uses selectors and declarations to determine what is changed.
`p {background: aqua;}`. The individual pieces of the declaration are the property and value that would need to be updated. 

To activste CSS in a page, you will need a link tag, href, tyoe, rel and style tags.
