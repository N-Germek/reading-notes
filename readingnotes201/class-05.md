## Lets make Everything Look Pretty

Images, Color and Text are all ways to engage the reader or user in any site.

Visual aids tend to draw the eye and the content of them can convey a myriad of information. Shops selling products may want an image to advertise what is being sold. Schools may want an image to convey what is being learned. Influencers may want to display an image to show off what they are thying to influence the user to get, use or go to.

How you display an image on your web page depends on what you will want to convey.  is the image less detailed with less colors like a diagram? Use a GIF or PNG.  It is a smaller file requiring less to adjust in size and style. Is this for a photography class or advertisement of what you can do as a photographer? JPG is your friend in relaying all the minute details that you will need to showcase your craft or what you can teach someone to learn.

Who wants on ly text and pictures on a webpage though.  That will make it no different from original textbooks or encyclopedias. Part of what makeas a webpage interesting is the colors that can be added to them. Background colors, section colors, types of colors all help to organize your page and maintain visual interest.  Are you trying to separate a section from blending into the entire page, highlight is with a different color to make the font pop! Want to look more ombre in the background to help the user follow along from top to bottom, then it may be time to look into gradients.  How about colors that are not meant to standout on their own but that are ment to be the supporting actor to your content? Well then the real fun will be in your types of colors, opaque, solid, metalic.  Color can help to relay intensity and importance.  

Images and Color aren't the only way to keek the user and reader engaged.  Text has many things it can do to relay relevance and content.  If you are showcasing caligraphy skills, wouldn't it be fun to have a text font that cound do that? Well your image of your completed personalized cards will go hand in hand with the calligraphy font in your appointment setting section on your page with a calming backdrop of an opaque color now wouldn't it.  Font size, alignment and style can all relay information as well as distinguish parts of your page from other parts.
