# What Google Learned About Teams

How to build a team, retain a team and manage a team are all basic necessities of any business to be successful. Determining factors to whether a project will be successful or not can be gaged by the results of productivity within a working team. As a massive corporation, Google learned a lot about this subject through investing millions into reworking their team environment.

Some managers learned that teams do not work well being micromanaged or having a lack of communication. Putting people together who liked each other outside of the workplace or putting people together who were similar in personality type was the initial logic to creating a productive team that they came to realize was unfounded. Google proved there was still learning to be had and so testing ensued to get to the bottom of it all.

Questions about motivation, socialization, hobbies, educational backgrounds, personality traits were all determining factors to gage the development of an individual, now apply those same questions to a team.  Individuals on their own were strong, yet strong individuals thrown together without a safe place to bring their whole selves to work in a team environment was the achilles heel to a successful team.

With that newfound knowledge it became more about understanding group norms to determine patterns and find out what exact behavior or groups thrived versus failed.  Once together weather it was majority rules or collective agreement, lack of equal communication and human empathy led to less positive results within the team.  Bottom line, Google learned that understanding group norms was the window into learning how to make a team successful.

The importance of psychological safety was the groundbreaking discovery after hundreds of teams and years of research. Let people be who they were and feel that they could safely be themselves in their work environment without being shamed, embarrassed or punished for being unique.  This freedom given to employees from employers and team members is ultimately what led to the best quality projects.

## Things I want to know more about:

The list of things I want to learn about is very vast, yet ultimately, how to properly pair program with larger groups across the cloud.

As for psychological safety, I would like to learn how things have changed as the working environment has changed to being more remote for those who read more off of body language and feelings through in person connection.
