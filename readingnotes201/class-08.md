## CSS Layout Deep Dive ## 

The magic of CSS starts in the layout and continues in the specifics of selectors, design, and the standard for defaults. 

To understand the display, you will first have to know what all it encompases. To begin **display** will determine if it is inline or block so the developer will know what type of elements to include in the page build. 

- Inline Elements: Sit next to each other and preserve white space. They also can't have a size set in width and height. 

- Block elements: Though they are greedy and take up a whole line, they are and can be made precise in size so as not to be a bully to the rest of the code going on. Margin is the only element deserving of such respeted.
