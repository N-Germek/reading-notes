# Lets Talk about Forms and Events

To begin, the purpose of forms are usually to gather information in one spot for the requester.  This information is used for a variety of things most of which are to help the person filling them out.  What used to be a format created in a microsoft word or wordpad page and printed, is now submited electronically on most sites.  

Filling out forms for your doctor's office, for tickets you are trying to purchase or simply infputing your information to create an account of some sort are all form examples that have moved to electronic versions. HTML is where those bones are built for layout, structure, what information is needed to be input where.  CSS is to make is look more uniform or to highlight different parts for importance.  Does your form need to have a co-signer or provider on it? this is where you would use CSS to style for creating separate pieces.

Events on the other hand are needed for quite a different purpose.  Concerts and Sporting events are all real world examples, yet the code needed in JavaScript to create those events are needed to get your ticket sales.  your client completes the neceessary fields in the form and now what? In a properly prepared site, you will have an event that will send that information to the requestor.  Submit button, Update button,  All are examples of events.
