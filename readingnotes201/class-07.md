Object - Oriented Programing, HTML Tables
As we have learned in the past, in JavaScript, almost everything is an object. Creating functions or methods with those variables or properties will allow you to be able to write condensed code within objects.

The purpose of the objects is to allow you to have a real world example of things that you would nedeed to relate to. these can be see in many plaecs and ways such as in hotel reservations, airline purchases, banking, shopping.

JavaScript has many propreties built in as defaults, yet there are many more that you can create. In the browser you will have two code to represent the objects in the web browser document as well as in the window. Window objects control properties in the window layout such as scroll distance, URL location. The methods in this will describe if an alert will prpompt for the user or if there is a command to print the contents of the page. The Document Object Model (DOM) is used to determine the properties and methods of your page that are visiable to the user. This ioncludes title, URL, web domain. The methods used help in selecting for CSS or HTML properties for easy ways to change multiples.

Ultimately the purpose of methods within objects are to take more complex data or larger quantities of data, manupulate it and return it to the user in a way utilixzed in real world application.
