# **Git Revisions and Uploads**

#### **Git Explanations and Uses**

### *Git is a DVCS file system used for snapshot storage.* 

<p> Snapshots are the placemarkers in time for when and what file change occured before being sent to the home database. DVCS is just one form of Version Control that are used by coders to save files, upload files, track and alert to changes in the files.  Version Control Programs are systems that allow the client to revisit and review files that have been saved at certain points also known as snapshots.

The other Version Control Systems are known as:

- VCS: Local version control, which is the database directly linked to save to hard drive. 
- CVCS: Centralized Version Control, database with branches to send and receive original code to multiple developers when collaborating, allows administrators to control what parts of the project they are sending the developers, also allows team members to see and act on changes without damaging the original file.
