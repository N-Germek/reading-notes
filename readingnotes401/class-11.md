# Jupyter

## What is Jupyter?

Jupyter is a web based user interface. It includes index editor tools. All image formats are available in standard view. Kernel backed documents enable code in any text file to be run interactively. You can open multiple tabs or splitviews to access multiple documents side by side. Jupyter notebooks are similar to Excel with the ability to build in code or markdown.

```python
- or = is used to zoom in or out.
[] is used ti Rotate Left or Right.
0 is used to reset.
```

## What is NumPy?

NumPy is a data analysis package. By using numerical and mathematical values, NumPy is able to assign, compare and update values in arrays, lists and many more structures.  It is more efficient and provides a shorter hand method of writing code.
