## What is a Django Model

Models are the way in which you create the skeleton of your site. For example a movie model may include the stars, the director, the genre, the title, the year released. Another model can include the name of the director, the years they have directed. Another model will include the movie instance which will include the weather itâ€™s in theatres, rental, or own status, year released. Build the models, add code to the models and django will do the magic in the background and build the site with a list of movies and include information based on what you are looking for from whichever library the movies are imported.

The model primer includes fields, methods and metadata. Any type and number of fields represents the data we want stored. The order of fields written can affect their tender order. Metadata controls the default ordering of your data returned.

Create update or delete methods using model management. To create, define an instance and call save(). To search records use QuerySet and objects.all() to find the objects attributes. The method filter() will allow you to filter through search results.
