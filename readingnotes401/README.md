## The Growth Mindset

### Upgrading your Technical Skills

Practice is key, specifically the things that are outside your comfort zone.
Be deliberate with your practice.  

>The questions to ask yourself to determine if you are utilizing deliberate practice are:
> Does it push you outside your comfort zone?
> Have you repeated it often?
> Is feedback on your results continuously available?
> Is it highly demanding mentally?
> Is it difficult?
> Does it require good goals?

If you answered no to any of these, then you are not utilizing deliberate practice.  

The challenges that you choose to tackle after asking these questions are ones that will challenge you the most. As such, the need to practice and repeat will be higher to gain full understanding and solution to the problem.  To determine if the challenge has been met and the solution has been created, simplified, and utilized you will want to test your results. Once the problem has been solved, deliberate practice no longer be utilized when you revisit a challenge or problem of the same type.  Mastery is an evolution of your skills. This is also the stage in which a new challenge should be faced to continue the momentum in your continued growth as a developer.

Some potential sites that will allow you to practice as a developer would be The Matasano Crypto Challenge or Rosalind. Both of these sets of exercises are developed with the purpose of continually challenging a developer to sharpen their skills and continue the evolution process.

### The Power of Believing That You can Improve

The power of not yet is the power to understand that if the goal isn’t reached that it isn’t a failure, it simply means that it hasn’t been reached yet. This evolved mindset leads to more positive results than the old mindset where if you aren’t an immediate success, you are a failure.  The power of yet unlocks the power of possibilities and creativity. Ways to make sure that the growth mindset is nurtured, is to praise wisely for the effort, perseverance, tenacity, versus simply praising for the end results. The confidence built helps even the playing field for those in unequal circumstances by providing the internal tools and opportunity to utilize their creativity to solve problems.

### How Does Grit Affect Success

Grit is the combination of passion and perseverance.  This characteristic is what can be the determining factor of whether someone is successful at hitting their goal or unsuccessful by the end point of that goal. SMART goals can always be changed and reset, yet to do so would require flexibility and the understanding that this goal would need to be closed out as not successful yet. Successful people with more grit means their goals are ones they continue to strive for regardless of what challenges are set in front of them.  The process of hard work and having the stamina to stick with the same goal until it is accomplished is the process of building grit.

### Gentler Philosophy of Success

The philosophy of success is ever-changing. The status symbols and ideals of what success should look like in the past societies versus the societies now have evolved to generalize a single being based on one aspect of them.  True success comes with the acceptance of loss and specifically leaves room for it.  The option to lose means the option to win is available, yet in order for both options to avoid feeling so catastrophic, one must first take the taboo of the allowance away.  Additional pressure does not make diamonds of people, it is simply more crushing for people when they lose.  The added pressure can make success seem unattainable when you are in a state of loss.  Loose the pressure of having to be successful at every aspect, and the idea of loss is no longer so crushing. In fact it breeds room for understanding and teamwork since it nurtures the idea that what ever you may not excel at, someone else may.
