# Welcome to Advanced Python

## Pain versus Suffering

The process of learning that we will be embarking on in this course is both extremely rewarding as well as extremely punishing.  How can it be both?  Simple, in Advanced Python, we will be learning more then people learn in over two years of study in university in less then six months.  The process will be grueling with research, frustrations, problem solving, brain stretching and lack of sleep. What is the reward?  Also simple, the knowledge of the language Python and the title of Full Stack Python Software Developer.  All of this is going to be painful as all growing pains are.  What it won't be though is suffering.  Suffering is pain with no purpose.  Well how much pain is your future worth?  Time for you to decide.

## Big O

Lets jump right in why don't we.  What is Big O?  Big O notation describes the preformance and complexity of an algorithm. O(1) is the time and space needed to solve an algorithm regardless of data size.  O(N) is the time and space needed to solve an algorithm relative to the amount of data being transfered.
