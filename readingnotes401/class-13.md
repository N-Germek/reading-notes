# Linear Regression

Linear Regression is the measure of predictions for 

```python
lm.fit() -> fits a linear model

lm.predict() -> Predict Y using the linear model with estimated coefficients

lm.score() -> Returns the coefficient of determination (R^2). A measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model, as the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.

.coef_ gives the coefficients and .intercept_ gives the estimated intercepts.


```
