# Cryptography

## What is cryptography?

Cryptography is the process of encrypting or decrypting information to be able to protect files. There are many ways to accomplish this one of which is the Cesar Cipher.

## What is the Cesar Cypher?

The Cesar Cypher is a sustitution cipher which substitutes one letter for another one later in the alphabet. This one specifically used a shift of three for the amount of letters in the aplhabet. In order to crack the code, the user would need to know the amount of shifts and waht the letters corresponded to.

## Cracking the Code

Some ways of cracking codes used in the past is by utilizing frequency Analysis. This is the process of identifying the frequency of a character and and it's statistical usage in the language. Using that statistical usage, we can make an educated guess of what the original character used to be.
