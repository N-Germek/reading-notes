# Testing and Modules

## TDD aka Test-Driven Development

Test driven development is the process of thinking and writing your tests for your code first.  The thought process behind it is that you have thought of all the ways that your code will break and you hacve tested it's output, inout and behavior. The behavior of the tests is that test names should be the same as the module names in the same snake case with an _test in the begining. This is to distinguish which test file is for which module.The cycle should include the three AAA's. Arrange data to execute the input. Act by executing your actual code to see it's behavior. Assert to see if your final output is what you expected.  Did you get a result that you didn't know about? Time to refactor your test or find out if you need to add in more tests.
