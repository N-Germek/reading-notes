# Graphs

Graphs are a datastructire comprised of nodes (called verticies) that are sometimes connected by lines (called edges).  A vertex is a single node that can have 0 or more adjacent verticies. An edge is the connection between nodes. the neighbor is the node connected to the one being referenced.and the degree is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Category of Graph

Undirected graphs are comprised of nodes in which there is no direction pointing to another specific node attatched to them by edges.

A directed graph (Digraph) has nodes in which they are specifically directed to another node.  

## Types of Graph

There are many types of graphs: Connected, Complete, Disconnected. Complete graphs are when all nodes in the graph are connected to each and every node in the graph. Connected graphs are when all verticies have at least one edge connecting them to another. Disconnected graphs are when there are verticies not connected to others.  The nodes are all part of the data structure, yet some nodes may have no edges at all.

Directed graphs without cycles (the ability to traverse back to the home node) are called acyclic. These can be represented as a tree.

Cyclic graphs start and end at the same node and are directional.

Graphs are represented two ways, adjacent matrix and adjacent list. adjacent metricies are represented as a two directional array. Adjacent lists are most common and represented by a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other verticies.

Weighted graphs are graphs with numbers assigned to the edges.
