# Ethics in Tech

In Bill Sourour's article, he reviewed the effects of his code on the recommendation for a pharmaceutical drug that a client had asked his company to be built.  I agree with his decision to leave the company that let the code go through since in the initial build, it came across that there were many people who would see it before production, and none had the moral stance or common sense to stop and ask if it would violate any principals of the Software Engineer's Code of Ethics.  Based on the article it looks as though principal 1 (Public), principal 2 (Client and Employer), principal 4 (judgement), principal 8 (Self) and potentially principal 3 (Product) and principal 7 (Colleagues) were all violated in Bill's and to some extent my perspective.  With the code written for the test, the troubling end result of all answers circling back to the drug gave a sort of false advertising for a drug that did indeed cause much harm to the public, no doubt the employer, the customer and obviously the team and software dev.  As soon as Bill became aware of the issues, he protected his family, then went on to leave the company that was representing it and shows remorse. I am curious to find out if he went to his superiors about it or brought it to anyone else's attention before he left though.

In the article "Will Democracy Survive big data and AI?", some of the biggest concerns highlighted are how all of this information and technological changes will impact the world. It was shocking for me to learn that there is a citizen score for Chinese citizens that will impact all or majority of their lives.  Learning that the results of whatever an algorithm scores you will determine your eligibility for movement and advancement is a little bit terrifying.  How and who will code in the ability to change since humanity and societies are showing that they are able to not only embrace change, but also lead it. I can see the dangers in letting AI control too much because the learned behavior is hard to unlearn when an algorithm is set to specific results.  I am curious to see how the power of suggestion, or the coded manipulation of big data will affect democracy as a whole. Is society strong enough to maintain the individual or will it continue to be driven by recommendations until there is a no further need for opposition or a chance to make that individual human experience decision?  When will humanity know to unplug from the grid and will society even allow it by the time it is realized that it is needed?

Personally, my family was affected by change when my mother who was a Medical Transcriptionist for over 20 years, had lost her job due to the invention of speech to text.  Initially, she took pay cuts when outsourcing began in the early nineties and late 2000's. She was forced to work longer hours just to make ends meet to be making the same amount that she was initially making all while inflation continued to go up.  Then with text to speech, instead of being paid by the line she typed up, she was paid pennies for proofreading until there was not even that left for her to do.  The text to speech was intended for doctors to be able to speak directly and have their notes completed right there and then, it would limit confidentiality breeches and make the information more readily at hand.  The lost jobs of all the medical transcriptionists, would be ignored.  The second set of eyes in a misdiagnosis where the symptoms stated one thing, but the verbiage was another are missed.  Though she was not the doctor, when she say thousands of transcriptions, she became familiar with the disease or illness names and symptoms. Many diseases are one typo away from being something else and when she would reach out for the doctor to clarify, errors would be located and corrected.  All programable, but pain-points that went through and affected many for a long time before being addressed.

Overall, there will be times in your career in which you will be asked to build something you may not agree with, what is important is to find out what is the real reason you don't agree with it and what is the real impact if you continue it.  All of those are important considerations when writing code as a software developer that can have either very rewarding or detrimental effects on yourself and many more.  Specifically with products that have a direct effect on the health and wellbeing of a person, culture, world or species, as the software developer building the code, you will want to conduct as much research as possible before releasing the end product.
