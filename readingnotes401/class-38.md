# React Builds

Conditional rendering is when you control what is rendered usinf conditions.  The action will not perform without the condition being met by built in locic through continional operators or conditional logic formulas.

Lists and Keys are accesses with curly braces and converted with the map() function after being assigned to a new variable and calling tha variable.

In forms, your primary tags are ```<input>, <select>, <textarea>```. These will need additional input for styling and to provide proper attributes to the selected action, then they will render properly in your form.

Utilization of the this.setState is the best way to share state bewteen components when you extend the components.
