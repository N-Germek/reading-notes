                        CSS is the code for beauty!  To be more specific, CSS is the code used to distinguish color, background, image size, font size and overall style to a webpage.  HTML gives you the content, however, if it was all in black and white only, what would make it exciting? CSS is what brings about the pizazz in a site.  It helps draw the attention to the reader to a specific location or text by making webpages visually appealing.  This can be used to draw the client's eyes to important pieces, basic navigation or give it the overall *OOH and AAH* effect that the owner of the site is trying t relay.
