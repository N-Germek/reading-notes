## The Beauty in CSS
 
    CSS is the code for beauty!  To be more specific, CSS is the code used to distinguish color, background, image size, font size and overall style to a webpage.  HTML gives you the content, however, if it was all in black and white only, what would make it exciting? CSS is what brings about the pizazz in a site.  It helps draw the attention to the reader to a specific location or text by making webpages visually appealing.  This can be used to draw the client's eyes to important pieces, basic navigation or give it the overall *OOH and AAH* effect that the owner of the site is trying t relay.
