# OAuth

## Lets Learn about OAuth

1. What is OAuth? OAuth is an open standard authorization protocol/framework. OAuth 2.0 is a framework and not a protocol.

2. Give an example of what using OAuth would look like. Some examples of how it looks to utilize OAuth is a user sends a request to print a file from their cloud to a printing services printer network. Another example would be if a user is signing in to a site and they are provided many ways to sign in with credentials stored in third party sites. Our live example would be signing into Netlify with either GitHub, your username and password or with your Google sign in information after you had already signed into one of those sites.

3. How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user? OAuth operates by having the two or more services work seamlessly together as it supplies the authorization for the user to access the information. It should be noted that OAuth is for authorization and not authentication. The process is to authenticate in one system and then OAuth caries that authorization approval through to other user sites that that same user is accessing without requiring the user to authenticate in every site.

4. What is OpenID?
