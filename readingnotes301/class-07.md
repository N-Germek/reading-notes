# REST

## What is Rest and How did it come to be?

1. Who is Roy Fielding? - Roy wrote the first web servers to the HTML protocol.

2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? - Simply put, they weren't designed that way. Machines now are so many and hold so much data, that API's are necessary to be able to access, process and move that information.  

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? - This protocol applies verbs to nouns. This helps the machine language understand the code language used to complete functions with API servers.

4. What does a GET do? - GET uses the URL for the website that you are looking for and pulls it to your browser using machine language.

5. What does a POST do? - POST adds content from one system to another.

6. What does PUT do? - PUT is the command to replace content that is being changed for example system updates.

7. What does PATCH do? - PATCH is the partial updating that will happen when a full system update is not necessary and you simply need to target one component. Thi happens most frequently for system updates and security patch needs.

## Things I want to learn more about:

One of the things I am curious about is how they created API's in the past for some of the LAN parties I attended.
