# React and Forms

Controlled components are combination of default state and mutable state. Aka “single source of truth”. Mutable state is controlled by setState(). Controlled component: input value always driven by React state. This lets you pass the value through other UI elements or reset values. < textarea > element defines its element by its children in HTML.  In React < textarea > uses a value. These can be written similar to single input lines.
