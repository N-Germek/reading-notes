# **Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry**

What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
At the same time that the decline happened for women in computer science, the personal computers came out to the general public.  With this change, marketing was almost primarily geared to men and boys which set an underlying gender role to the science.

Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

This mattered because the practice skills needed in the industry had been honed by males.  Families were less likely to buy a computer for a female even when she displayed interest in computer science because there was that gender role assigned.  Movies at the time set up the expectation that the pretty girl would fall for the nerdy guy and as a society, this became the role of women towards the geeky guy.

**When are diversity efforts most successful?**

If the leaders and the executives of a company are driving for diversity, the success rate is higher to accomplish that goal.

**Why do diverse companies perform better?**

Diverse teams carry more perspectives and this makes them smarter and more creative with their solutions. Through working smarter it is no surprise that their efficiency translates into more profitability for the company.

> "In a 2011 study of diversity in the top firms in Standard & Poor's Composite 1500 list, researchers found "female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.""

Homogeneous companies miss out on talent if they are not able to look past the individuals background which leads to individuals not applying to those companies. Smart people do not want to work with ignorance so they will take their talents elsewhere. Additionally, those same individuals would be needed to serve the same diverse consumer base the company is attempting to target.

**Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**

The needs of each community are different. For example some communities have far greater needs in transportation. If the perspective of a developer who has had this struggle is taken into account, the building of alternative means of transportation will be that persons focus. This would obviously help the developer, yet it would also help the community as a whole. Work life balance would be achieved. Companies needing employees to be at work on time or at all would benefit with having a workforce that is not affected by the obstacle of transportation. Everyone wins.

## Things I want to know more about

I would like to learn about ways that I can approach a company if there is an obvious diversity issue that they are not making a priority to change. Since the topic is sensitive, how it is approached is just as important as when and if.
